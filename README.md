![ExampleImage](https://i.gyazo.com/2f32c5e7ff1ab13df17ccb2b5e3b7aa6.png)

This project was for the daily challenge 1 on [Peter's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cGhEZuk) It was written in exactly 1hour & 42mins.

Essentially it's a warpper around the API: [swapi.co](swapi.co.). It finds a ship by Id, creates a file named the Starwars ships name or renames the old file is it see's a .json in the directory it's placed in.
It also fills out the contents of said file with the Ship Info.
